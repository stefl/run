Hello! Thanks so much for sponsoring me with my running challenge. It’s the end of February so I thought I’d send an update on how things are going. 

## Fundraising update
So far, we’re at £890 of my £1500 target! That’s great - thank you so much for your support!

## Blogging my progress 
I have made a new running blog that you can check out to see all of my training. I’m writing and sharing photos as I go: https://run.stef.io

It probably won’t surprise you, but I’ve become quite interested in the data that you can collect whilst running. Speed, cadence, heart rate, and lots more. I’ve been recording all of my runs since the very first one in August, and I’ve uploaded them into Strava. But the problem is, most folks aren’t using it. So I rolled up my sleeves and I’ve made an automated blog based on all of my runs recorded in Strava. I know, I know, of course I did! And before you ask, no I’m not going to turn it into a startup. 

## An update on my challenge: two half marathons and the London Marathon
A few of you supported my fundraising back in January when my plan was to run one half marathon at the end of March. Things escalated when I was lucky enough to get a London Marathon place through my work. So I’m running two half marathon races this month and then on April 26th, a full marathon! 

If you donated via the Year of Colour / Half Marathon page, I’ve merged the total into my main fundraising page so it’s all in one place. 

## Progress so far
It’s been somewhat surprising how intense the training for a marathon is. I should probably have read up on what it involves in advance, but where’s the fun in that? 

As of today I’m now running 50km (31 per week, and for six weekends in a row now I’ve been running a half marathon distance or longer. 

It’s been quite intense - I’m going out four days per week, and apparently it’s mainly all about “getting the miles in” so your body gets used to the strain. 

I’m still doing a Saturday parkrun every week or so too. If you’re not familiar, it’s a free get-together for folks at all levels of running ability and we all run a 5k route at the same time, at our own pace. It’s very motivating!

I’m now able to run 5k in under 22 minutes, and although I’ve not tested myself at any kind of formal event, my 10k time is about 52 minutes, and my fastest half marathon in training this month was around 2 hours. Bearing in mind when I started all this I got puffed out after one minute, this is all quite a revelation to me that I can even do this. 

So, I’m feeling hopeful I can complete the marathon in under 4 hours!

## No injuries 
I’ve had some niggles and pains along the way. My left hip and knee are hurting much of the time, but not enough to worry too much about it I think. I’m keeping an eye on it! Part of this whole experience has been getting to know my body a lot more, and trying to understand what’s a bad pain versus a “body adapting” pain. 

## Support and guidance
I wouldn’t be able to do any of this without the support of my wife, Emily. It feels quite unfair on some days when I go out for these runs and leave her to handle the kids. And she’s been helping a great deal with advice and nutrition. We’ve shifted our diets a lot over the last few months, so we’re eating a lot more vegetarian meals and Emily is helping me make sure I’m eating well throughout the week. Thank you!

On top of that, thanks to all the folks who have been sending supportive and helpful advice along the way, on Strava, Instagram, Twitter, email, face to face. I’m really listening to folks who have done this before, so cheers for sharing.

## Coronavirus
There have been some rumblings about the coronavirus spread interrupting various planned sporting events. The Tokyo marathon has been cut down significantly, for instance. So far, the London Marathon organisers are saying that they’re monitoring the situation. I’m going to work on a Plan B if the worst happens, which I hope it doesn’t!

## Thank you
And finally, thanks for supporting me in this challenge. Only two months left now!

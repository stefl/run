It's the end of another month, so despite everything that is going on in the world, I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my running challenge for those of you who have been following along so far.

## Starting the month on a high

On the 1st of March I ran my first running event - the Big Half, which was brilliant. Sunny, but not too hot, and I felt strong and healthy. I was really pleased to run quicker than I thought I would and get [a personal best of 1:46:34](/workouts/2020/03/01-ea3058d7-7814-5a2e-bbc6-f83f07447bd5)!

## The London Marathon was postponed

The big news, of course, was that the big target event I have been training for has been postponed. I knew coming into the month that this had to happen, and I felt a great deal of relief when it was finally confirmed. 

I paused fundraising because I wasn't quite sure what to say, given the new lockdown restrictions that the government announced.

So far, we’re at [£1076 of my £1500 target](https://run.stef.io/donate). Thank you so much for your support!

## Ten weeks, ten half marathons!

I'd reached a point with my training where I was running a half marathon every Sunday. Through February this was quite brutal, with all the storms we had. But I kept it up through March as the weather improved. I've now reached ten weeks in a row where I've run a half marathon. More on this at the end.

## My knees are recovered

For a few weeks in February I was suffering a fair bit because of the effort of running so far each weekend. But through March, the pain subsided, and I'm now at the point where I run that long distance on a Sunday, and there's no more limping around that day and the next. It's been helpful wearing a knee brace on my left leg, and dialing down the speed. I'm now feeling stronger than I think I can remember!

## Dialling back the training

I paused the Marathon training programme that I was using, and have been going out on three or four runs per week, slightly reducing the distance, and not pushing it as hard. I'll probably stick with that in April.

## Local Landmarks Half Marathon

One of the races I'd signed up for was also postponed. It was my birthday weekend, but they've rebranded from the "London Landmarks" to "Local Landmarks". I completed that that day, which was a great feeling - who'd have thought from one birthday not doing any exercise, to the next I'd be running that far?!

## Learning to avoid people

You'll see from my running log that I've been learning to run in the middle of the road, and stay as far away from other people as possible when I'm out. I'm stopping, crossing the road, going round cars, staying away from the parks, trying to run at unusual times, and lots more to keep myself and others safe. It's a very different style than getting in the zone and ignoring other people!

## A challenge for April and May

So, with the London Marathon off, I'm thinking of what challenge I can work towards. And perhaps it's to see how many weekly half marathons I can pull off in a row during this period. Perhaps 21 is the number to go for? 21 x 21 km? That would take me up until mid June to complete!

I don't want to run the full marathon distance because I think it's dangerous and could expose me to illness. But I'm comfortable with these two hour runs, so I'm planning on continuing with that, assuming that it's allowed, and I'm healthy.

## Maintaining positivity and resilience

Mainly, I'm doing my best to stay fit and healthy, and I'm finding that going out running is really helpful to reduce stress and help me think straight when my mind is spinning about all the terrible news. It's going to get pretty bad over the next few weeks. I've written [an update on Instagram about resilience](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-c4jdcJUtd/) that you might like to read too. Stay safe, everyone.
